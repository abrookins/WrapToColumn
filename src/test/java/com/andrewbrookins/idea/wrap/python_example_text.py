"""
This is a module with a very long line in its docstring. The line goes on and on. Who would write such a long line? Only a monster would write lines this long.
Another line after that very long line comprises a paragraph. This is a paragraph of two very long lines. A monster would write such long lines, but not me, the author of this plugin. I would never.

And then the docstring has a shorter line. Why? I don't know.

It ends with two very short
lines and then a blank line.
