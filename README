ABOUT

This plugin wraps selected text or, if no text is selected, the current line
to the column width specified in the editor's "Right Margin (columns)" setting.

This is a replacement for the Fill Paragraph command, which doesn't work for me.


INSTALLING

You can install this plugin directly from an Intellij editor inside the
Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse repositories... window.

To install the latest zip from GitHub, clone the repository, open your Intellij
editor of choice, go to the Preferences window -> Plugins -> Install plugin
from disk, then choose the WrapToColumn.zip file located in the source repo.


COMMAND

The default command Command+Control+Shift+W. Feel free to change that beast in
your keymap.


LICENSE

This plugin is licensed under the GPLv2. I would have preferred a different
license, but I derived some code from a Python plugin released under GPLv2.
Sorry. See COPYING.
