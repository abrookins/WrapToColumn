ABOUT

This plugin wraps selected text or the current line, if no text is selected, to
the column width specified in the editor's "Right Margin (columns)" setting.

This is a replacement for the Fill Paragraph command, which doesn't work for me.


INSTALLING

Download the source, open your Intellij editor of choice, go to the Preferences
window -> Plugins -> Install plugin from disk.


COMMAND

The default command Command+Control+Shift+W. Feel free to change that beast in
your keymap.


LICENSE

This plugin is licensed under the GPL because I derived some of its code from
a Python plugin released under that license. See LICENSE.
